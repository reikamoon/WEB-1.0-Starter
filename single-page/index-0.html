		<title></title>	 <!-- This is the title tag. The title tag defines the name of the document, and is also the name you will see on your tabs on your browser. -->

		<!-- TO DO: Start with markup for each section -->
		<main>

			<nav id="nav">
			<!-- This is your navbar. Here, you can add links/buttons to different sections or sites for easy access.  
			Nav links can just lead to certain sections of the webpage as well.
			These links should navigate to each of the 5 sections within this page.
			Keep everything you want in your navbar within the nav tags! -->
			</nav> 

			<section id="banner">
			<!-- This is where your banner will be located.
			Your banner needs a full width image like the demo, and a message or title in the center of the image.  
			-->
			</section>

			<!--Now, you need to create THREE cards with information. 
			Each card should have: 
			- an image
			- some text
			- a CTA(Call to Action) Button. 
			CTA Buttons are often used in websites to guide users to make a certain action. When browsing through articles, you'll often see buttons that say "Read More." That is an example of a CTA button! 
			Some other examples would be: Sign Up, Download Now, Log In, Email Us buttons.

			<section id="topic-1"></section>
			<section id="topic-2"></section>
			<section id="topic-3"></section>


			<footer id="contact">
			<!-- Now, you need to make a footer with a contact form.
			If you look back at the demo, at the very bottom of the page is a form called a contact form.
			There are FOUR fields for users to input their information: 
			- Name 
			- Email
			- Subject
			- Message
			You might want to add some text or labels on each field so the users know what each field is for.
